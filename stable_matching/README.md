# Stable Matching Algorithm

Long story short:

The stable marriage problem (also stable matching problem or SMP) is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element. A matching is a mapping from the elements of one set to the elements of the other set. A matching is stable whenever it is not the case that both: some given element A of the first matched set prefers some given element B of the second matched set over the element to which A is already matched, and B also prefers A over the element to which B is already matched.
